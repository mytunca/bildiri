<!-- ## TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC!

Urgent Appeal Regarding Ongoing Humanitarian Crisis -->

**We, physicians gathered from various regions of Turkiye with conscientious sensibilities, come together with the awareness of responsibility imposed on us by history in the proximity of a region where for years, in the Palestinian land of Gaza, genocidal civilian massacres have been taking place.**

It is impossible for us to remain silent in the face of the **genocidal** civilian atrocities perpetrated in Gaza by the occupying Israel, under the guise of "self-defense," with a consciousness of solidarity with the Palestinian people who have been subjected to occupation and oppression.

We address the global public with the awareness of being in solidarity with the Palestinian people; since October 7, 2023, a systematic genocide has been carried out in Gaza by the Israeli occupiers.

In Gaza, all the rules of international law are being violated by the Zionist Israel and its army. Israel is acting like a terrorist organization, indiscriminately targeting civilians, women, men, children, and newborns, without the means to defend themselves. 

This occupying army, supported by its allies in terms of technology and military power, has killed 11,328 civilians, including 4,650 children and 3,145 women, according to recent records. Civilians whose exact numbers we do not know are also awaiting under the rubble.

Violating all humanitarian norms and rules of war, the occupation policy includes bombing civilians receiving health services in hospitals and the personnel providing health services.

Hospitals where essential needs, including water and food, are not met, operate under bombardments with limited medical supplies/devices, and anesthesia-free surgeries have been performed. 

A new war crime that will never be forgiven has been committed with the disconnection of electric and oxygen support, causing premature infants in incubators to be separated from respiratory devices. 

Ambulances have been bombed, and civilians have been condemned to die at the scene. Honorable 'white-flag' physicians and dedicated healthcare personnel practicing their heroic professions have also suffered from this brutality, resulting in hundreds of losses. 

We extend our greetings and prayers to all these heroic colleagues. However, **we are ashamed that 100 Israeli doctors, who advocate the destruction of hospitals in Gaza, are our colleagues.**

In Gaza, devastated by thousands of bombs, including white phosphorus bombs, people and other living beings are dying under the debris without being rescued. The bodies of those martyred are not even allowed to be collected. 

People are prevented from accessing water, electricity, and food, and aid trucks sent from other countries are held at the border. In the area where wastewater mixes with the streets, it has been reported by the hospital chief that stray animals attack the corpses. Gazans forced to migrate on roads face dangers such as the risk of infectious diseases and attacks by occupying Israeli soldiers. 

**The genocide seen in Nazi Germany in history is being implemented by the occupying Israel in different ways.**

Regardless of the reasons, these crimes against humanity are unforgivable both in the conscience of society and according to the rules of international law. 

No justification can justify this genocide. As sensitive physicians of the Republic of TÃ¼rkiye, we support the dignified resistance of the Palestinian people and call on the entire world to take a moral stance. Continuing to shout that when even one person is killed, all of humanity is killed, we will not remain silent in the face of this brutality under the mission of preserving the sanctity of human life.

**We appeal to all international organizations and authorities!**
- **Ensure the right to life of civilians in Gaza.**
- **Stop this massacre by implementing necessary sanctions.**
- **Hold all those responsible for war crimes accountable on international platforms.**
- **Open border gates to allow aid entry.**
- **Take urgent measures to provide medical support and equipment for the treatment of the injured in the region.**

We hope that actions against genocide and massacre will be continued by all our colleagues without borders. 

As health volunteers, we are ready to fulfill the historical responsibilities that fall upon us.

We present this to the attention, knowledge, and conscience of the global public.
