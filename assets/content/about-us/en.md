Our platform is founded by a group of physicians with the aim of **speaking up for those who are  under opression no matter which creed, language, race or gender they came up with.**
Our immediate focus is Palestinian land, which is in urgent needs. We also pursue the aim of provoking the spirit of altruism and solidarity with those who have been denied from their basic rights among doctors

On November 16th 2023, in order not to keep silent against an opression beyond the limits of humanity and to achieve permanent ceasefire; we have signed a press release with over 4000 supporting collegues that united against a savagery which has been carried out in Palestinian land and has reached the extent of genocide. We, as volunteers with the virtue of sharing and as physicians who adopted the wisdom of Hikmet Boran, are against every form of oppression.

In this regard our priority is to keep Palestinian case on agenda. In this process we will stand with every psychological, moral, physical and financial support. In this regard we will keep consulting and be in coordination with our colleagues. We welcome every suggestion and contribution.
